    <h1>Push-Ups: The Ultimate Guide</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="push_ups.jpg" alt="Push-Ups">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Push-ups are one of the most effective bodyweight exercises for building upper body strength. They target the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core, making them a versatile and essential movement for any fitness routine.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <h3>1. Setup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> Begin in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels.</li>
            <li><strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Position your hands directly under your shoulders. Your fingers should point forward or slightly outward.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage Your Core:</strong> Tighten your core muscles to maintain a straight body position throughout the movement.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Execution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lower Your Body:</strong> Inhale and slowly lower your body until your chest is just above the floor. Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body.</li>
            <li><strong>Press Up:</strong> Exhale and push through your palms to return to the starting position. Focus on engaging your chest, shoulders, and triceps.</li>
            <li><strong>Lockout:</strong> Fully extend your arms at the top of the movement without locking your elbows. Maintain a straight body line.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Finish the Set</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rest:</strong> After completing your reps, rest in the plank position or lower your knees to the floor if needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
        <div class="advanced">
            <h3>1. Decline Push-Ups</h3>
            <p>Place your feet on an elevated surface (e.g., a bench) to increase the difficulty and target the upper chest and shoulders.</p>

            <h3>2. Diamond Push-Ups</h3>
            <p>Bring your hands close together, forming a diamond shape with your thumbs and index fingers. This variation emphasizes the triceps.</p>

            <h3>3. Plyometric Push-Ups</h3>
            <p>Explode off the ground at the top of the movement, clapping your hands before landing. This builds explosive strength.</p>

            <h3>4. Archer Push-Ups</h3>
            <p>Shift your weight to one arm while extending the other arm out to the side. This variation increases unilateral strength.</p>

            <h3>5. One-Arm Push-Ups</h3>
            <p>Perform the push-up using only one arm. This advanced variation requires significant core and upper body strength.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sagging Hips:</strong> Keep your core engaged to avoid letting your hips drop. Your body should remain straight throughout the movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Flaring Elbows:</strong> Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body to reduce shoulder strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Incomplete Range of Motion:</strong> Lower your body until your chest is just above the floor and fully extend your arms at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Rushing the Movement:</strong> Perform each rep slowly and with control to maximize muscle engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Improper Hand Placement:</strong> Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart for optimal form.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety Tips</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm-Up Properly:</strong> Perform dynamic stretches and light sets to prepare your muscles and joints.</li>
                <li><strong>Start with Modified Push-Ups:</strong> If you're a beginner, perform push-ups on your knees to build strength.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Stop immediately if you feel pain or discomfort.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain Proper Form:</strong> Focus on keeping your body straight and your elbows at a 45-degree angle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Push-ups are a fundamental exercise for building upper body strength and endurance. By mastering proper technique, incorporating advanced variations, and following a structured training program, you can maximize your results and achieve your fitness
            goals.
